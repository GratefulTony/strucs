By November
- Json encoding using json4s
- example using disjunction (Either)
- Try or Either instead of Option for decoding, scalaz Validation ?

Easy
- documentation for encode/decode
- finish enums in FixCodecSpec
- Example with pre-defined Struct type (say OrderSingle), verifies that it does not compile / that it compiles regardless of the insertion order

LONG-TERM - hard
- look at the compiled byte-code for optimization: does the AnyVal have any effect ?
- use packed arrays
